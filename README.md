# azure-mdp-framework

The Antares MDP Framework is a standardised ingestion engine which follows best practices when adopting a new modern data platform over a Data Lake. It is a metadata driven framework which allows developers to simply configure source system ingestion and spend more time developing data engineering and report writing. Its highly extensible so that if a new source system needs to be incorporated it can be developed once, reused, and repeatable. Out of the box it is underpinned by a complete DevOps CI/CD development and release lifecycle to accelerate an end-to-end modern data platform solution.
